# Welcome to the Bountiful contributing guide!

There are multiple ways with which someone can contribute to Bountiful. I appreciate any and all help from outside contributors!

## New contributor guide

To get an overview of the project, read the [README](README.md).

### Ideas

If you have new ideas or feature requests for Bountiful, they can be added to the [discussion page](https://github.com/ejektaflex/Bountiful/discussions)
or discussed on Discord!

### Translations

If you are multilingual and would like to contribute translations of Bountiful into other languages, you can do so here:

https://crowdin.com/project/bountiful

Note that any contributions made to translations will be licensed under the same license as the rest of this repository
when synced. If you do not see your language, ask, and we can consider adding it to the project. Translations are synced
into the dev branch periodically for use in new versions of the mod.

Even if your language is already listed, it's always helpful to have another set of eyes looking over it for corrections!

### Code

If you'd like to contribute code towards the project, feel free to fork it and then make a pull request. It is expected 
that all new code should practice standard Kotlin style conventions.

# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical issues in the quest system that prevent proper functionality. The current system has limitations that block players from taking multiple quests, provides poor user experience with generic quest ticket names, and lacks the ability to complete quests through the bounty board interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Multiple Quest Support

**User Story:** As a player, I want to be able to take multiple quests simultaneously, so that I can work on several objectives at once and have more engaging gameplay.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player attempts to accept a quest THEN the system SHALL allow acceptance if the player has fewer than the maximum allowed active quests
2. WHEN a player has active quests THEN the system SHALL NOT prevent them from accepting additional quests up to the limit
3. WHEN checking quest acceptance eligibility THEN the system SHALL verify available quest slots rather than blocking all additional quests
4. IF a player reaches the maximum quest limit THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
5. WHEN a player completes or cancels a quest THEN the system SHALL free up a quest slot for new quests

### Requirement 2: Informative Quest Ticket Names

**User Story:** As a player, I want quest tickets to display meaningful information about the quest, so that I can easily identify which quest each ticket represents in my inventory.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a quest ticket is created THEN the item SHALL display the quest title as the item name
2. WHEN a player views a quest ticket in inventory THEN the tooltip SHALL show quest details including objective and rewards
3. WHEN multiple quest tickets are in inventory THEN each SHALL be clearly distinguishable by name and tooltip
4. IF a quest has a time limit THEN the ticket SHALL display remaining time information
5. WHEN a quest ticket is displayed THEN it SHALL include the target profession/class information

### Requirement 3: Quest Completion via Bounty Board

**User Story:** As a player, I want to complete quests by using Shift+Right Click on the bounty board while holding a quest ticket, so that I can turn in completed quests and receive rewards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player holds a quest ticket and performs Shift+Right Click on a bounty board THEN the system SHALL check if the quest is completed
2. IF the quest objectives are fulfilled THEN the system SHALL award the quest rewards to the player
3. WHEN a quest is successfully completed THEN the quest ticket SHALL be removed from the player's inventory
4. IF the quest is not yet completed THEN the system SHALL display a message indicating remaining objectives
5. WHEN quest completion is processed THEN the system SHALL update the player's active quest list
6. IF the quest has expired THEN the system SHALL prevent completion and display an appropriate message
7. WHEN rewards are given THEN the system SHALL provide feedback to the player about what they received

### Requirement 4: Quest Progress Validation

**User Story:** As a player, I want the system to accurately track my quest progress, so that I can complete quests when I have fulfilled all objectives.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player performs actions related to quest objectives THEN the system SHALL update quest progress accordingly
2. WHEN checking quest completion status THEN the system SHALL verify all objective requirements are met
3. IF a quest has multiple objectives THEN ALL objectives SHALL be completed before the quest can be turned in
4. WHEN quest progress changes THEN the system SHALL persist the updated state
5. IF a quest has time-sensitive objectives THEN the system SHALL validate timing requirements

### Requirement 5: Error Handling and User Feedback

**User Story:** As a player, I want clear feedback when quest operations fail, so that I understand what went wrong and how to proceed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a quest operation fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message explaining the issue
2. IF a player attempts invalid quest actions THEN the system SHALL provide guidance on correct procedures
3. WHEN quest limits are reached THEN the system SHALL inform the player of the current limit and active quest count
4. IF quest data is corrupted THEN the system SHALL attempt recovery and notify the player if manual intervention is needed
5. WHEN quest completion fails THEN the system SHALL explain which requirements are not yet met

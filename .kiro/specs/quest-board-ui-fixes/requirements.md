# Quest Board UI Fixes Requirements

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical UI issues in the quest board system that prevent proper quest interaction and visual feedback. The current implementation has problems with quest selection highlighting, tooltip display, and quest acceptance logic that need to be resolved for a functional user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Quest Selection Highlighting

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see visual feedback when I click on a quest in the left panel, so that I can clearly identify which quest I have selected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player clicks on a quest button in the left panel THEN the corresponding quest should be highlighted in the center display area
2. WHEN a quest is selected THEN it should have a distinct visual indicator (border, background color, or glow effect)
3. WHEN a different quest is clicked THEN the previous selection should be cleared and the new quest should be highlighted
4. WHEN no quest is selected THEN no highlighting should be visible

### Requirement 2: Quest Tooltip Information

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see detailed information when I hover over quests, so that I can understand quest requirements and rewards before accepting them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player hovers over a quest in the left panel THEN a tooltip should display quest details
2. WHEN a quest has no tooltip information THEN appropriate fallback text should be shown
3. WHEN hovering over different quest elements THEN relevant contextual information should be displayed
4. WHEN the mouse leaves the quest area THEN the tooltip should disappear

### Requirement 3: Quest Acceptance Logic

**User Story:** As a player, I want the quest acceptance system to work reliably, so that I can successfully accept quests that match my profession.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player has the correct profession for a quest THEN the quest should be acceptable
2. WHEN a player already has an active quest THEN appropriate feedback should be provided
3. WHEN quest acceptance fails THEN clear error messages should be logged and displayed
4. WHEN a quest is successfully accepted THEN the UI should update to reflect the new state

### Requirement 4: Error Handling and Logging

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can diagnose and fix quest system issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN quest operations fail THEN detailed error information should be logged
2. WHEN network packets are missing or invalid THEN graceful fallback behavior should occur
3. WHEN UI state becomes inconsistent THEN automatic recovery mechanisms should activate
4. WHEN debugging is needed THEN sufficient logging information should be available

### Requirement 5: UI State Synchronization

**User Story:** As a player, I want the quest board UI to stay synchronized between client and server, so that my actions are properly reflected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a quest is accepted THEN both client and server should update their state
2. WHEN UI interactions occur THEN proper network synchronization should happen
3. WHEN state mismatches occur THEN reconciliation mechanisms should resolve them
4. WHEN multiple players interact with the same board THEN state should remain consistent

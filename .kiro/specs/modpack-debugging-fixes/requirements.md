# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical debugging and fixes for a Minecraft 1.20.1 Fabric modpack with the Origins mod. The modpack is experiencing three primary issues: JSON parsing errors causing crashes, non-functional keybindings for global skills, and texture loading failures. These issues prevent proper gameplay and need systematic resolution to ensure stable modpack operation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a modpack player, I want the modpack to launch without JSON parsing errors, so that I can start playing without crashes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the modpack launches THEN the system SHALL successfully parse all JSON configuration files without EOFException errors
2. WHEN a JSON file is malformed or empty THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating which file needs attention
3. WHEN JSON files are validated THEN the system SHALL confirm all mod configuration files are properly formatted
4. IF a JSON file is corrupted THEN the system SHALL either regenerate default values or provide repair instructions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player using the Origins mod, I want the global skill keybinding (G key) to function properly, so that I can access my character's abilities during gameplay.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player presses the 'G' key THEN the system SHALL activate the bound global skill functionality
2. WHEN keybinding conflicts exist THEN the system SHALL identify and resolve conflicting key assignments
3. WHEN the Origins mod keybindings are checked THEN the system SHALL verify all skill-related keys are properly registered
4. IF the global skill system is disabled THEN the system SHALL re-enable and configure it correctly
5. WHEN in-game THEN the player SHALL be able to see visual feedback when pressing the global skill key

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a modpack user, I want all Origins mod textures to load correctly, so that the user interface displays properly without missing graphics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Origins mod GUI is accessed THEN the system SHALL successfully load all required texture files including resource_bar2.png
2. WHEN texture files are missing or corrupted THEN the system SHALL identify the specific files and their expected locations
3. WHEN texture loading fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback textures or regenerate missing files
4. IF texture paths are incorrect THEN the system SHALL correct the file path references in the mod configuration
5. WHEN the mod is fully loaded THEN all GUI elements SHALL display with proper textures and no placeholder graphics

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a modpack maintainer, I want comprehensive diagnostic information about mod conflicts and compatibility issues, so that I can prevent similar problems in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN debugging is initiated THEN the system SHALL scan for mod compatibility issues and version conflicts
2. WHEN log files are analyzed THEN the system SHALL identify patterns that indicate specific types of failures
3. WHEN fixes are applied THEN the system SHALL document the changes made for future reference
4. IF multiple mods affect the same functionality THEN the system SHALL identify potential interaction problems
5. WHEN the modpack is tested THEN the system SHALL verify all fixes work together without introducing new issues

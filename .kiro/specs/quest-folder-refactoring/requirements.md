# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves refactoring the quest folder to remove unused files, optimize code structure, fix chat message issues, and ensure all functionality continues to work properly. The goal is to clean up the codebase while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove unused files from the quest folder, so that the codebase is cleaner and easier to maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the quest folder THEN the system SHALL identify all files that are not referenced or used by other parts of the codebase
2. WHEN removing unused files THEN the system SHALL ensure no compilation errors occur
3. WHEN removing files THEN the system SHALL verify that all existing functionality continues to work

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to optimize the code structure in the quest folder, so that the code is more maintainable and efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing existing code THEN the system SHALL identify opportunities for code optimization
2. WHEN optimizing code THEN the system SHALL reduce code duplication where possible
3. WHEN refactoring methods THEN the system SHALL split large methods into smaller, more focused methods where appropriate
4. WHEN making changes THEN the system SHALL ensure compilation succeeds after each change

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want proper chat messages when clicking on quest tickets, so that I understand why I cannot take certain quests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN clicking on a quest ticket for another class THEN the system SHALL display exactly one message stating "билет для другого класса: (название класса)"
2. WHEN clicking on a quest ticket for my own class THEN the system SHALL not display the "wrong class" message
3. WHEN clicking on any quest ticket THEN the system SHALL not display duplicate messages
4. WHEN clicking on quest tickets THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate feedback for the action

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure all changes are validated through compilation, so that no breaking changes are introduced.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making any code changes THEN the system SHALL compile the code using compileJava
2. WHEN compilation fails THEN the system SHALL fix the errors before proceeding
3. WHEN all changes are complete THEN the system SHALL ensure the final code compiles successfully
4. WHEN refactoring is complete THEN the system SHALL verify that all existing functionality works as before
